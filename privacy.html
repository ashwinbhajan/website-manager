    <h1>Privacy Policy for Website Manager</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: April 09, 2025</strong></p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Website Manager is a Chrome extension developed by Ashwin Bhajan to help users save, organize, and manage website URLs efficiently. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding that data.</p>

    <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect the following data when you use Website Manager:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User-Generated Content</strong>: Website URLs, categories, and product names that you enter into the extension. This data is stored locally on your device using the Chrome storage API.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not collect:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Personally identifiable information (e.g., name, address, email address, age, or identification number).</li>
        <li>Health information (e.g., medical history).</li>
        <li>Financial or payment information (e.g., credit card numbers).</li>
        <li>Authentication information (e.g., passwords).</li>
        <li>Personal communications (e.g., emails, texts).</li>
        <li>Location data (e.g., IP address, GPS coordinates).</li>
        <li>Web browsing history (e.g., pages visited).</li>
        <li>User activity (e.g., clicks, keystrokes).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note: If you include sensitive information within the URLs, categories, or names you enter, that data will be stored locally as part of your input, but we do not process or extract it separately.</p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <p>Your data is used solely to provide the core functionality of Website Manager, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Saving and retrieving your website URLs, categories, and product names.</li>
        <li>Organizing and searching your saved websites.</li>
        <li>Copying URLs to your clipboard when requested.</li>
        <li>Supporting import and export features for your website data.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All data is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to our servers or any third parties.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, share, or transfer your data to third parties, except as required by law (e.g., in response to a legal request). Your data remains on your device and is managed entirely by the extension.</p>

    <h2>5. Permissions</h2>
    <p>Website Manager requires the following permissions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>storage</strong>: To save your website data locally on your device for persistence across sessions.</li>
        <li><strong>clipboardWrite</strong>: To allow you to copy website URLs to your clipboard from the extension’s interface.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These permissions are necessary for the extension to function as intended and are not used for any other purpose.</p>

    <h2>6. Security</h2>
    <p>Your data is stored locally on your device using the Chrome storage API. It is not encrypted at rest, as it remains under the security protections provided by your device and Chrome’s environment. We do not have access to your data, and it is not sent over the internet unless you export it manually.</p>

    <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have full control over your data within Website Manager:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Access</strong>: View your saved websites in the extension at any time.</li>
        <li><strong>Edit</strong>: Modify or update your URLs, categories, and names as needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Delete</strong>: Remove individual entries or all data via the extension’s interface.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To delete all data, simply uninstall the extension from Chrome, which will clear all locally stored information.</p>
